        <h2 class="aboutTitle"> When Is Mardi Gras?</h2>
        <p class="aboutPara">Mardi Gras is traditionally celebrated on “Fat Tuesday,” the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday
            and the start of
            Lent. In many
            areas, however, Mardi Gras has evolved into a week-long festival.

            Mardi Gras 2023 will fall on Tuesday, February 21. Following two years of canceled events due to the
            COVID-19 pandemic,
            celebrations in New Orleans resumed in 2022.</p>
        <h2 class="aboutTitle"> What Is Mardi Gras?</h2>
        <p class="aboutPara">Mardi Gras is a tradition that dates back thousands of years to pagan celebrations of
            spring and fertility, including
            the raucous Roman festivals of Saturnalia and Lupercalia.

            When Christianity arrived in Rome, religious leaders decided to incorporate these popular local traditions
            into the new
            faith, an easier task than abolishing them altogether. As a result, the excess and debauchery of the Mardi
            Gras season
            became a prelude to Lent, the 40 days of fasting and penance between Ash Wednesday and Easter Sunday.

            Along with Christianity, Mardi Gras spread from Rome to other European countries, including France, Germany,
            Spain and
            England. </p>
        <h2 class="aboutTitle">What Does Mardi Gras Mean?</h2>
        <p class="aboutPara">Mardi is the French word for Tuesday, and gras means “fat.” In France, the day before Ash
            Wednesday came to be known as
            Mardi Gras, or “Fat Tuesday.”

            Traditionally, in the days leading up to Lent, merrymakers would binge on all the rich, fatty foods—meat,
            eggs, milk,
            lard and cheese—that remained in their homes, in anticipation of several weeks of eating only fish and
            different types
            of fasting.

            The word carnival, another common name for the pre-Lenten festivities, also derives from this feasting
            tradition: in
            Medieval Latin, carnelevarium means to take away or remove meat, from the Latin carnem for meat.</p>

        <h2 class="aboutTitle"> The Origins of Mardi Gras</h2>
        <p class="aboutPara">Mardi Gras’ origins can be traced back to types of ancient pagan festivals and medieval
            European traditions of
            Saturnalia and Lupercalia, celebrations held in anticipation of spring. Upon the arrival of Christianity to
            Europe,
            these festivals morphed into religious holidays, as it was easier to combine rather than abolish the
            region’s
            established traditions into the new religion. These specific festivals' dates coincided with the Easter
            holiday. Thus,
            Mardi Gras became the six-week prelude to Lent, the 40-day period of fasting that precedes Easter


        <h2 class="aboutTitle">How many countries celebrate Mardi Gras?</h2>
        <p class="aboutPara">According to The Economist, Mardi Gras is celebrated in more than 50 countries, including
            Europe, North America, South
            America, Asia, and Africa. While the celebrations vary from place to place, they all feature a hedonistic
            combination of
            indulgent feasting and debaucherous revelry tinged with a dash of religion.

                        <h3>LaToya Cantrell is an American politician serving as the
                            Mayor of New Orleans,
                            Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office.
                        </h3>
                        <p>In 2012, Cantrell declared her candidacy for the New Orleans City Council seat vacated when
                            former District B
                            representative Stacy Head won an election to an at-large position. After the November
                            election, candidate Dana Kaplan
                            and Cantrell advanced to a December runoff, which Cantrell won with 54 percent of the
                            vote. Cantrell served out the
                            balance of Head's term, and was unopposed for a full four-year term in 2014.

                            As a member of the Criminal Justice Committee, Cantrell participated in efforts to install
                            crime cameras in her
                            district, assess the effectiveness of citywide anti-gun-violence campaigns, and address
                            understaffing at the New Orleans
                            Police Department.</p>
